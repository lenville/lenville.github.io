title: Hello World
---
Welcome to [Lenville's Blog](http://blog.lenville.com/)! This is my only post in 2014. People who want to make a change always suffer such daily stresses patiently. One more step, one more pain, one more gain. Socrates said:

> "The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new."

So I wish I could make it, go across the Pacific Ocean and discover the delights of the American Cultures. For now, just the year of 2015, what I gonna challenge is:

 - Better English
 - Better Front-End Engineering
 - Better Life Style
 - Keep learning Python for gadgets
 - Start learning Golang
 - Start getting in touch with Economy & Finance on my own way

May everything goes well with people who care about me all the time.
